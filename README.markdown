***My graphical implementation in Flutter of an IMEI validation app. :iphone: :lock: :dart: :joystick:***

## ABOUT :books:

Since I implemented my algorithms to validate IMEI numbers, I thought, to showcase my Flutter skills that I'd give my Dart validation library a shiny frontend. This repository contains the source code for that shiny frontend.
